  Currently, I am planning to build a real-time Speech-to-Speech translation Software as my B-Tech Project. I'll be using the Open-Source <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech">DeepSpeech model from Mozilla</a>(for Speech-to-Text), building a custom Model(for Text-to-Text), and using an API for Text-to-Speech once more. One idea is to build several models for dialects of my home country.
